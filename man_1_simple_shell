.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B simple_shell
program provides a minimal, interactive command line interface that
parses commands, locates executables in the user's PATH, and executes them.

It supports:
.IP \[bu] 4
Interactive and non-interactive modes
.IP \[bu] 4
Built-in commands such as
.B exit
and
.B env
.IP \[bu] 4
Basic error handling and status reporting
.PP

The shell reads commands from either standard input or a script file,
tokenizes them, then searches for the corresponding executables.
If an executable is found, the shell forks a new child process
and executes the command in that child.

.SH USAGE
.PP
Users can invoke the shell by simply running:
.RS 4
.EX
simple_shell
.EE
.RE
.PP
When run interactively (e.g., in a terminal), the shell prints a prompt
such as:
.I "#cisfun$"
.PP
When run non-interactively, the shell reads from stdin until EOF.

.SH BUILT-INS
.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell with the status of the last executed command.
.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables.

.SH OPTIONS
The
.B simple_shell
program does not currently support command-line options in this version.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP \[bu] 2
To run simple shell interactively:
.RS 4
.EX
$ ./simple_shell
#cisfun$ ls
#cisfun$ /bin/ls
#cisfun$ env

.IP \[bu] 2
To run a command list from a file:
.RS 4
.EX
$ cat commands.txt
ls
pwd
exit
$ ./simple_shell < commands.txt
.EE
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, returns the exit status of the last executed command
or 0 if no commands were executed. On error, returns a non-zero value.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The
.B simple_shell
relies on the
.B PATH
environment variable to locate executables.  
Additionally, it uses and may modify:
.IP \[bu] 4
.I HOME
- home directory for certain built-in expansions  
.IP \[bu] 4
.I PWD
- current working directory
